Geckolib is an entity animation loader for Java Edition, which lets you export bedrock animations and play them automatically.

## Installation
[![curseforge](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/versions/geckolib.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/geckolib)
![Java CI with Gradle](https://github.com/bernie-g/geckolib/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Gradle/badge.svg?branch=develop)

We use jitpack for publishing as it provides easy access to releases and allows for javadocs in the jars (unlike curseforge).

For 1.15.2:
```gradle
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.bernie-g:geckolib:1.15-1.0.2'
}
```

For 1.12.2:
```gradle
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.bernie-g:geckolib:1.0.0-1.12'
}
```
## Documentation
GeckoLib provides detailed documentation in the form of a [wiki](https://github.com/bernie-g/geckolib/wiki) and javadocs. GeckoLib is currently available for 1.12 and 1.15.
